# Bamboo Green Color Theme

This is a simple green color theme for VSCode.

I have tried to use the same green color throughout the theme in order to give it an eye catching green.

This is still a work in progress. So some colors might look funky, too bright, or too dark.

## Suggestions

I am always open to suggestions about how to improve this theme!
